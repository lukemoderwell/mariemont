Jesus was a man’s man, and becoming like him means we will lay down our lives for the benefit of those around us.

We believe God has called men to provide proactive and sacrificial leadership in their families, in the church, at their places of employment, and in the community.

For us, that looks like all men realizing their sonship to the Father, married men loving their wives well and discipling their children toward a relationship with Christ, and single men devoted to the church and Kingdom building.

Here are some of the things we do:

* **Men's Retreat**: 

The next retreat is October 4-5,2019.
Contact Rob Seetin rjseetin@gmail.com for more information.

* "Men United" Breakfasts with New Mission Missionary Baptist Church

* Small Groups: Wednesday Nights (bi-weekly)

* Workdays at the church 

* Help out at the Family Shop

* **Bible Study**: Meet on Fridays at the Parish Center at 6:30am
