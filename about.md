We are a church community that is living and loving in Jesus. Join us every Sunday morning at 9:00 or 11:00 for a time of worship and teaching. Whether you are exploring what it means to have a relationship with Jesus or have already started that journey, there is a place for you here.

## What to Expect

We all get together on Sundays to worship God. We do this in many ways. We sing songs to God which is a lot like prayers set to music. We share stories or testimonies of God’s love and power. We teach using the Bible as our authority, and from time to time remember the sacrifice Christ made for us through Communion. Both buildings are handicap accessible.
