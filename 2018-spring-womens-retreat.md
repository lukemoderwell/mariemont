Have you ever thought about sowing spiritual seeds? How is your spiritual garden growing? How beautifully
could the “gardens” of our families, churches, and communities grow as we sow seeds of grace with our words,
our works, and our walks?

Please join us for our annual 2019 Women's Retreat. Our speaker, Kim Knight, will focus on how we can
“cultivate” a life of worship and how we can “sow seeds” of grace with our words, our works and our daily walks. There will be time for learning, study, discussion, reflection, free time, and Holy Yoga.

We’ll begin with dinner on **Friday, March 2, at 6:15pm** (registration begins at 5 pm) and finish Saturday, March 3 by 4:00 pm. Our retreat will be nearby at the Jesuit Retreat Center in Milford, and the early bird cost is only $65 (if registered on or before February 4) or $85 (after February 4- Feb. 18). You’ll get three delicious meals,extra snacks, fun, great teaching, and comfortable lodging. Registration forms are available at the Connect Desk in the Parish Center or go to www.mariemontchurch.org (payment must be made separately). A limited number of spaces are available.

Scholarships are available, upon request.
For questions, contact Beth Swift at swiftclan@gmail.com.

Take time to “cultivate” your spiritual garden, to make new friends, to worship, and to draw closer to God. We hope you’ll join us!
