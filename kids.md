**Kids at Mariemont Church**

Mariemont Church is committed to raising up strong, spiritually healthy children. From 6 months to 6th grade, we are empowering families to lead children in developing their own faith in Christ and to put that faith into action.

Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” (Matthew 19:14)
