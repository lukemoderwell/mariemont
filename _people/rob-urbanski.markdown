Rob has been an elder for four years and has been attending Mariemont Community Church for 11 years with his wife, Laura, and two sons, Logan (21) and Colton (18). Rob came to Christ during college after being witnessed to during his teenage and early college years, where he met Laura. They have been married 27 years. He and Laura have served as youth leaders, led small groups, and helped people manage their finances. He and Laura lead Financial Peace University at MCC, plan youth mission trips, and lead a weekly small group. Rob loves advising the local Scouting organization we sponsor (his two sons are both Eagle Scouts) and Laura is a college math instructor who loves tutoring at-risk kids.
