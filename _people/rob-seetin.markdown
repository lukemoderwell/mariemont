Rob has been an elder at MCC for a little more than a year. He grew up in a military home and moved often as a kid. His church background began with his grandparents, who were heavily involved in the SBC and ran a food pantry. In 2002 Rob had a life altering experience with Jesus. Rob served several years with a high school youth group in Colorado Springs, where he met and served with his wife, Leslie.  He used his gifts as a hair stylist to share the Gospel with his clients and co-workers and  to serve orphans and missionaries on mission trips. He briefly served as youth pastor at a church in Colorado Springs before moving to Cincinnati, where he embarked on a new career journey in the financial services industry. Rob currently leads the Men’s Ministry and a weekly Men’s Bible Study. Rob is the only elder with tatts.
