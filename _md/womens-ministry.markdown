The vision of the Mariemont Church Women’s Ministry is to encourage women of all ages to grow in their faith and equip them to be beacons of light in their homes, communities and workplaces. This is accomplished by providing opportunities for growth through study, service and warm fellowship with one another. Additionally, Women’s Ministries strives to help women mature in their faith by strengthening their bonds with one another.

## Equipping

Sharing the goal of having every member grow through participation in Bible study, Women’s Ministries offers a variety of studies for women in the church and women who may not be members of Mariemont Church. Studies are Bible based, providing perspectives for applying Christian principles to a woman’s life, and are typically taught by women from our community.

### Joy In The Morning
For over 20 years, this study has been held on Tuesday mornings from 9:15-11:15am in the Emery Room of the Parish Center during the school year and provides an application -oriented Bible Study for women. Fellowship time builds relationships and trust among the broad range of women who attend. Loving childcare is available for a small fee. Traditionally, this has been a great outreach in the community.

Meet with other women Tuesday mornings from 9:15 – 11:30am for fellowship, fun and study.  Loving childcare is available for a small fee. Specific study materials are TBD.

### J.O.Y. Luncheon

The J.O.Y. (Just Older Youth) Luncheon is in the Parish Center on the second Wednesday of each month. Women of all ages are welcome! We meet from 11:00 – 1:00 for Bible study followed by lunch. If you are not on the reservation list and would like to attend email Lois Barbro at lois@mariemontchurch(dot)org.  But, we always welcome those who haven’t made reservations, too!

### Women’s Retreat

Mariemont Church Women’s Retreat is usually offered in the spring. The purpose of this event is to help women grow in their faith by focusing on a topic (such as Spiritual Gifts) and to build relationships among women. The retreat environment enables connections, trust and deeper sharing among the women.

### Serve

Everyone is encouraged to utilize their spiritual gifts and serve God in many capacities in the church, whether in the office, teaching children, worship team, or many other areas. There are several specific areas of service:

### The Family Shop

For over 25 years, Women’s Ministries has provided affordable second hand clothing to those in need; both for sale and then free to missionaries or relief organizations. Volunteers use this clothing ministry as a means of reaching people by providing needed clothing and as opportunities arise, sharing the Gospel message. The proceeds of the sales are used to support Women’s Ministries, outreach to undeserved women in the local community (ie. Prison Ministries – Ohio Reformatory for Women’s Tapestry and Kairos programs) and also for projects within the church. We will always accept donations of toiletries shampoo, lotions, toothpaste, soap – no pump applicators) for the women in the Tapestry and Kairos programs. Bring items to to the office!

### Take Them A Meal (Food Chain)

Take Them A Meal is an outreach food ministry to MCC church members who are in need of meals on a temporary basis due to surgery, illness, newborns, etc. Those in need contact Mariemont Community Church through Lois Barbro who, in turn, contacts the coordinators. Scheduling is set up on the Internet through Takethemameal.com and volunteers are advised of the specific needs and sign up accordingly. Three meals per week for two weeks are provided, but additional meals can be requested. Coordinators are Lynn Robinson and Terry Robinson.
