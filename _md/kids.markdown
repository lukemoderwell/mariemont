Traveling VBS Ministry Team
June 2016 (TBD)

We are forming a team of students and parents to serve inner city children and engage in other ministry field trips and opportunities. Our traveling team of Junior High, Senior High, elementary students and parents will go to Bright Star Baptist Church in the West End to serve inner city children for five mornings. Field trips and other ministry opportunities will be offered each afternoon. If you want to serve, tutor, and have some fun with us please contact Leslie Seetin, leslie@mariemontchurch.org.

Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” (Matthew 19:14)
