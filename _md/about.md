We are a church community that is living and loving in Jesus. Join us every Sunday morning at 9:00 or 11:00 for a time of worship and teaching. Whether you are exploring what it means to have a relationship with Jesus or have already started that journey, there is a place for you here.

## What to Expect

We all get together on Sundays to worship God. We do this in many ways. We sing songs to God which is a lot like prayers set to music. We share stories or testimonies of Godâ€™s love and power. We teach using the Bible as our authority, and from time to time remember the sacrifice Christ made for us through Communion. Both buildings are handicap accessible.
