This is a Gospel and discipleship issue - looking at Jesus' example in John 4\nJesus - one of the majority takes the first step\nJesus reveals the woman's sin\nShe changes the subject to wrong ideas of worship\nHe corrects her and reveals he is her messiah\nShe runs into town and the harvest of Samaritans comes to fruition\nJesus overturns 700 years of racial enmity in two days - Gospel power\nWE NEED CHANGE  - AND ONLY THE GOSPEL WILL DO!\n\n3. Providing practical biblical next steps for us to continue our journey.\nWe must be committed to righteousness AND justice (Isaiah 9:7, Psalms 103:6)\nJesus told the Pharisees that they missed the weightier matters of justice (Matt 23:23)\nSpeaking out is not useless - Job, Ezekiel and Jesus on the yeast of the Pharisees\nPrayer - persevering prayer for justice is what Jesus taught (Luke 18:1-8)\nCome pray with us Wednesday nights from 7-8 on the front porch socially distanced\nListen and empathize (James 1:19, John 13:34-35, Romans 12:15, Galatians 6:1-10)\nWay of love (Ephesians 5:1-2)\n\n1.

How Do I Use Them?","description":"Jamie shares 6 observations about Spiritual Gifts from 1 Peter 4:10-11:\n1. Every believer is \"gifted\" (v10a)\n2. Gifts are for loving service of others (v10b)\n3. There is a diversity of giftedness (v10c)\n4. Gifts can be neglected (v10c)\n5. Gifts can be categorized by supernatural: a) speaking; or b) serving (v11a)\n6. Gifts point others to the Father and the Son (v11b)\n\nPractical Suggestions (if you don't know what your gifts are, or how to use them):\n1. Ask the Spirit for the mind and heart of Jesus for those around you\n2. Open your eyes to those around you and be present (put the phone down)\n3. Ask the Father to manifest His Grace and Presence to the person in front of you\n4. Begin to either speak words of encouragement (as you feel led), OR physically serve the person in some way - just start doing something that is loving! (speaking or serving)\n5. Pray and ask for more gifts (1 Cor 14:1, \"earnestly desire . . .\")","date_published":1591228800000,"views":77.0,"likes":5.0,"comments":1.0,"video_duration":1170.0,"medium":"youtube","average_view_duration":386.0,"average_view_percentage":33.07,"total_views_duration":29722.0,"source":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QVlRopjpdlc"},{"id":"C4FWWUb7B5A","title":"A Story of Giving","description":"Jess Moore shares a personal testimony about the Discipline of Giving.","date_published":1591142400000,"views":61.0,"likes":6.0,"comments":0.0,"video_duration":754.0,"medium":"youtube","average_view_duration":329.0,"average_view_percentage":43.74,"total_views_duration":20069.0,"source":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C4FWWUb7B5A"},{"id":"C0Llikg7DaU","title":"Denis: The Satisfying Spirit-Filled Life","description":"Denis shares his discovery of the Spirit-filled life.

The Greatest Story Ever!","description":"Happy Star Wars Day! (May the 4th Be With You!)\n\nThe Great Story of Scripture has 7 Acts (below is taken from Christopher J. H. Wright):\nAct 1: Creation. The whole drama begins when the one living and eternal God chooses to create what we call the universe\u2014heaven and earth. He creates it \u201cgood,\u201d and he creates human beings in God\u2019s own image, to rule and serve his good creation.\nAct 2: Rebellion. Humans choose to distrust God\u2019s goodness, disbelieve God\u2019s word, and disobey God\u2019s instructions. As a result, sin and evil enter into every dimension of human life, personal and social, and also corrupt all cultures and bring damage and frustration to creation.\nAct 3: Promise. The story of the rest of the Old Testament begins with God\u2019s promise to Abraham that not only will he become a great nation (Israel), but also that through them God will bring blessing to all nations on earth. That promise and hope drives the story forward through the history of Israel in the Old Testament era, as we shall survey.\nAct 4: Gospel. The promise of the Old Testament comes to fulfillment when Jesus of Nazareth is born. The great central act of the drama of Scripture includes all that we read in the four Gospels: the conception, birth, life, teaching, atoning death, victorious resurrection, and ascension of Messiah Jesus.\nAct 5: Mission. The promise to Abraham must be fulfilled. The good news of what God has accomplished through his Son Jesus must go to all nations. This is launched at the end of the Gospels and the beginning of Acts, after the outpouring of the Spirit of God on the followers of Jesus.\nAct 6: Final judgment. The good news is that evil will not have the last word and God will ultimately put all things right (which is what judgment means in the Bible) by dealing with and destroying all that is wrong and evil. Act 6 is the completion of God\u2019s answer to act 2 and of the accomplishment of act 4.\nAct 7: New creation. The Bible drama ends with a dramatic new beginning! After putting all things right, God will make all things new and will come to dwell with redeemed humanity in his restored creation forever.\n\nChristopher J. H.

The reason I am sharing with you is that in my writing process I try to invite God into my creative space. While I don\u2019t do this every time, when I do, I can feel Him guiding my thoughts and my pen. I look at creativity in the 3 parts, practice, discipline, and invitation, more on that in the video!\n\nI have recently been inspired by the imagery in the Psalms, in particular, Psalm 36:5-10 (ESV).               I believe there is creativity in all of us, though this looks different in each person because we were made in the Creator\u2019s image. We just need to invite His presence into our project and let him flow through us. I challenge you to invite Him into your next project, I think you might just be surprised!

Said another way, Following Jesus is impossible on our own power! Spiritual disciplines are therefore not a checklist of \"to-do's\" but rather means of grace that enable us to be transformed into the likeness of Jesus. They are opportunities to grow and become more like Jesus.
