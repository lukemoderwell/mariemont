The Mariemont Community Church Preschool and Elementary Extended Care are both outreach ministries of the Mariemont Community Church.  Our goal is to serve sacrificially, on Christ’s behalf, to the children and their families from the Mariemont and neighboring communities. As a result of connection, the children and their families will be drawn closer to Christ. Our goal is also to demonstrate the love of Christ in the way facility and staff work together continuously to demonstrate excellence and wholeheartedness befitting followers of Christ.

**The preschool is a traditional program, which teaches simple Christian truths and values for children ages 2, 3, 4, or 5**. It is designed to help children develop social, emotional and cognitive skills while engaging in various learning centers and participating in small and large group activities.  Children also enhance their motor skills while playing with manipulatives and participating with indoor/outdoor activities.  We believe the foundations for academic success are laid through building self confidence, allowing the child to progress at his/her own pace, and providing a caring and stimulating environment.

**The elementary extended day is a before and/or after school program, which teachers basics simple Christian truths and values for children kindergarten through sixth grade.** It is designed to give the parents who work full time a safe and fun learning environment for their children.  While at our center, the children are able to engage in art, manipulatives, games, science, writing and reading activities.  In addition, the children who attend our aftercare program are given a snack, have access to outdoor/indoor physical activity and are given adequate time to do their homework.

The staff and I hope you will find our Preschool and/or elementary Extended Day program a good fit for your child.  Information about our classes, policies, and general information can be found on our webpage.
